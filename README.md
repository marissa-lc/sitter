# sitter

## User Story

* As a parent/pet owner I want an app that allows me to save and track my child/pets schedules, * emergency contact info, food restrictions, etc so that I can easily share that info with their babysitter/pet sitter and ensure that my child/pet are receiving the quality and standard of care that I would like them to have.


## How it Works:

### User starts by securely logging into/creating an account:
        * Name
        *Email
        *Password

### IF USER IS A PARENT/PET OWNER:

### User will then create a profile for their Household that includes individual profiles for each child/pet:
        *Name 
        *Age
        *Photo 
        *The user can then add information such as:
        *A schedule
        *Meal plans
        *Allergies/Food restrictions
        *Emergency contact info (also options to input doctor/hospital info and phone numbers like poison control or emergency vet services)
        *Screen time or favorite toys.

### IF USER IS A BABYSITTER/PET SITTER:
        *User will finish their profile by adding:
        *Name
        *Photo
        *Availability 
        *Do they have a car “yes” or “no”
        *Short bio (optional)
    
    
* Users will be able to add Households and wait for the parent/pet owner to accept the request.
Once a household has been successfully added the user will be able to access the child/pet profiles.

* This creates an easy and accessible way for parents/pet owners to communicate with their child/pets caregivers by having up to date and relevant info vs verbally communicating as you rush or the door or trying to write everything down that you think is important at the time.

* This will also simplify things if you are using multiple caregivers or need care for multiple things.
